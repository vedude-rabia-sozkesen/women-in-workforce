# Project Proposal: Women in the Workforce in the USA  

## 1. Project Overview  
In this project, I will analyze the *number of women participating in the workforce in the USA* as my main data point.  
To better understand the social and economic factors influencing women's workforce participation, I will examine
additional parameters related to *social sciences, family life, and women's roles in society*.  

## 2. Additional Parameters  
To explore the relationship between women's workforce participation and broader societal dynamics, I will incorporate the following factors:  

•⁠  ⁠*Marriage rates*  
•⁠  ⁠*Number of women having children*  
•⁠  ⁠*Average age of women at childbirth*  
•⁠  ⁠*Education levels of women*  

## 3. Data Sources
